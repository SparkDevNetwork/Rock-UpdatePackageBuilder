        <releaseNotes>Rock McKinley 7.1

+ Added a delete confirmation when deleting members from the Leader Toolbox.
+ Added a new Attribute type of 'Lava Field', which allows a Lava template to be added to entities and will render its contents as the value. This will be helpful in creating more descriptive settings and configuration panels.
+ Added a new block setting that can be used to prevent entering a future date in the Group Attendance Detail block.
+ Added a new configuration option to the Attendance Analytics block to limit the available data views in the filter to specific category(s).
+ Added a new 'Label' field type. This makes it easier to add a label to a specific person and/or group that will always print when that person checks in, or when anyone checks into that group. This is an advanced configuration done outside the normal Check-in Configuration block.
+ Added a new Manage Members security action to the group and grouptype models that can be used to grant users the ability to add, edit, and delete members in a group without having the ability to edit or delete the group.
+ Added new blocks for viewing interaction data.
+ Fixed an exception that would occur in the statement generator if a pledge exists with a maximum end date value (12/31/9999).
+ Fixed an issue where the required field indicators were not showing on the New Family control.
+ Fixed an issue where workflows would process the wrong User Entry Form if multiple forms existed in the same Activity or a single Activity was activated multiple times.
+ Fixed an issue with Check-in not displaying the correct message or the countdown timer when the kiosk was closed but had an upcoming schedule for the same day.
+ Fixed an issue with Check-in using the people/group/location auto check-in option, which had allowed people to check-in again to the same service despite the option to prevent this being selected.
+ Fixed an issue with Font Awesome brand icons on the Login block.
+ Fixed an issue with NMI transactions not saving the Name On Card value after processing a transaction.
+ Fixed an issue with not being able to select items when using an iOS device.
+ Fixed Attribute Editor to allow editing the default values of field types that have multiple entry fields (i.e., Group Role).
+ Fixed the EnumField and EnumsField attributes so that they support being used more than once on a block.
+ Fixed various field types so that attribute values of the types can be reverted back to the default values.
+ Fixed workflow processing so that if a redirect action occurs with remaining workflow entry actions, the redirect still happens.
+ Updated communications to fix an exception that would occur if certain communication fields (e.g., subject, from name, etc.) were too long.
+ Updated the Attributes block to prevent  multiple global attributes being created with the same key.
+ Updated the Bootstrap Button to support a completed text and/or message that can be displayed for a set duration after the post back completes.
+ Updated the Bulk Update block to allow setting a new Communication Preference.
+ Updated the CodeEditor control to display correctly even if it is not initially set to be visible on a block.
+ Updated the Communication List block to use the communication name when subject is empty (i.e., for SMS communications).
+ Updated the Create Labels check-in action to look for labels configured on the person, group and/or location objects rather than only the group type object.
+ Updated the device search by hostname functionality in Check-in to match against the IPAddress field.
+ Updated the editing of family attributes so that updates are logged to history.
+ Updated the Group Member List block to display any group member note values when hovering the mouse over the note icon.  Also added an option to display the notes in a separate column instead of only showing an icon.
+ Updated the merge document process to no longer delete word fields from the template when merging data.
+ Updated the Metric Detail block to display the ID of the metric to assist in Lava development using metrics.
+ Updated the Person Property Update workflow action to support setting a person's communication preference value.
+ Updated the Schedule Detail block to support viewing and editing attributes associated with schedules.</releaseNotes>
