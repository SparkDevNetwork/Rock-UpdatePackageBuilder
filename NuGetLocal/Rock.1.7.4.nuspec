+ Added the ability to filter interaction blocks by a specific person through the query string.
+ Added the ability to set the connection opportunity via a block setting on the Connection Opportunity Sign-up block.
+ Fixed a bug in the Calendarlava block where switching between week and month without clicking on the calendar first would select the first week then the previous month.
+ Fixed a history point creation exception on event registration.
+ Fixed an exception that would occur in the Group Sync job when attempting to create a login for a person with no name.
+ Fixed an issue preventing user-drawn geofences from filtering groups and people.
+ Fixed an issue that kept inline Lava shortcodes from having recursive capabilities.
+ Fixed an issue that was causing the 'send signature document reminder' to create a new document instead of using the existing one.
+ Fixed an issue when impersonating another user that would result in the Restore button not always being visible in the administrator toolbar.

+ Fixed bug in Purchased Plugins page that would throw exception if a previously purchased plugin was not installed.

+ Fixed check-out success message to correctly show the schedule name instead of the frequency.
+ Fixed Communication Entry to create recipient correctly when linked to a person from another page (i.e., from Person Profile).
+ Fixed confirmation email for registration never being received. Changed email send logic to better fall back on global org email for the from address if one is not specified in the email object.
+ Fixed error in the batch list that prevented batches in the grid list from being opened or closed using the drop down list. (Fixes #2977)

+ Fixed exceptions that would occur if an attribute's value was null (possibly caused from migrating data).
+ Fixed FileUploader to pass correct arguments when using a grid to store the control.
+ Fixed Group Edit showing Security Role checkbox for users with Edit privileges but not Administrator. Group Edit will only show the Security Role checkbox if the current user is a Rock Administrator.
+ Fixed issue in Fundraising Matching (Transaction Entity Matching) where transactions could be falsely matched after saving changes to one batch, switching to another batch, then saving changes on that batch.

+ Fixed issue where escaped HTML gets displayed in a grid.

+ Improved performance of the Batch List block.
+ Removed hyphens from "Thank-you" and "on-going" throughout Rock.
+ Updated EventItemOccurrencesSearchLava, EventDetailWithOccurrencesSearchLava and EventItemOccurrenceListLava to include 'All Campuses' event occurrences when filtering by campus. This makes the functionality consistent with the CalendarLava and EventItemOccurrenceListByAudienceLava block, which include 'All Campuses' events when filtering by campus.
+ Updated exception logging to always log to the RockExceptions.csv file during startup.
+ Updated Giving Amount data filter to include people who didn't have any transactions when doing a Less Than filter.
+ Updated how person and family history records are created so that it is now only created in one shared place instead of each block having to create the history records.
+ Updated Number box to display integers, and Currency box to display with two decimal places. iOS keyboards default to the correct input.
+ Updated the Account Picker control so that it defaults to using the account Name (instead of Public Name) and added a new property to control whether the public name should be used.
+ Updated the Attendance Analytics block so that it can be specific to an individual group.
+ Updated the attendance block to add an additional merge field (AttendanceDate) to the roster merge document for passing in the date that the attendance is for.

+ Updated the Auto Select Days Back option in Family Check-in so that a value of zero will never auto select anyone.
+ Updated the Bulk Update block to improve performance when updating a large number of people.
+ Updated the Calendar Lava block to accept date parameters from the query string.
+ Updated the Check-in Schedule Builder block to support configuring schedules for group types that support check-in, but are not configured through the check-in areas.
+ Updated the Communication Entry Wizard block to remember the template category selection a user selects and default to that same category the next time they create a communication.
+ Updated the Communication Entry wizard not to use hard-coded table widths in order to assist with media queries.
+ Updated the Communication Wizard to indicate that CC/BCC recipients will recieve an email for every recipient in the communication.
+ Updated the configuration of Event Registration so if a '$' character is included with fee cost(s), it will no longer cause an issue.
+ Updated the Connection Request Detail block to hide workflows that are inactive or the user is not authorized to view.
+ Updated the custom Rock check-in font. If you've installed this on your printers, you may want to update it. In some cases, the icons on this font will not accept the proper placement information from the label. See the related Github issue for more details.
+ Updated the Dynamic Data block to support decrypting encrypted values returned by the query.
+ Updated the editor in the new Communication Wizard block so that the controls toolbar is fixed and does not scroll off the screen when scrolling the email content down.
+ Updated the Email Preference Entry block to allow user the option of updating their email address, and added configuration option for customizing which options are displayed.
+ Updated the Family Pre-Registration block to use the Date Part Picker instead of the Date Picker for birth dates.
+ Updated the File Browser to actually disable the Rename, Move and Delete buttons when they are disabled.
+ Updated the Financial Transaction List block to include Batch Id when exporting to excel.
+ Updated the Giving Analytics block to support filtering transactions by Transaction Type.
+ Updated the Grade Transition Date global attribute to use a month/day picker, and updated the grade and graduation date logic so it works consistently regardless of culture.
+ Updated the Group Attendance Detail block to allow people with Manage Members security to update attendance.
+ Updated the Group Finder block to only consider 'Active' group members when calculating capacity (to be consistent with all the other places capacity is checked).
+ Updated the Help text on the pledge blocks to clarify the meaning of the total amount and pledge frequency.
+ Updated the HtmlEditor to prevent an issue where switching to WYSIWYG mode would rearrange the text if there were Lava commands. Now Rock will detect if there are Lava commands and automatically start in code editor mode. It will also display a warning and prevent the editor from going to WYSIWYG mode if there are any Lava commands (e.g., if the code contains a {% for %} loop around an HTML Table Row [tr], Rock will detect the Lava and prevent WYSIWYG mode).
+ Updated the Interaction reporting for Short Links to be more readable and show the fields that one would be interested in when looking at short links.
+ Updated the Line Chart Dashboard Widget block to support getting more than one metric partition context from the page.
+ Updated the location services to automatically enable the Smarty Streets integration if no other location services were enabled. Now that Smarty Streets is free it will be default ON. You can turn it off if you wish and it will not be enabled again in the future. Also, removed the Administrator Check-list item for enabling location services.
+ Updated the person badges to align better with Font Awesome 5.
+ Updated the Person Merge block to show unlisted phone numbers with an indicator that it is unlisted. This makes it easier to determine the correct phone number to use.
+ Updated the 'Set Defaults' text on the Dynamic Report block to say 'Reset Filters' so that it better indicates what the link will do.
+ Updated the site's 404 page to display with a result status of 404. Before it would show the page 404 page, but not set the HTTP status to be 404.
+ Updated the Summary of Contributions panel on the Contributions tab of the Person Profile to allow showing less after the user has selected to show more.
+ Updated the text of the Next button on family check-in to be configurable.
+ Updated the Transaction Matching block to remove the unused 'Show Selected Accounts Only' block setting. This functionality is actually controlled by a filter setting and is specific to each user.
+ Updated the Universal Search site crawler to process a robots.txt file correctly and fixed a possible stack overflow issue that would occur if page hierarchy was deep enough.
+ Updated the way SMS Response Codes are generated to prevent infinite loops.</releaseNotes>
