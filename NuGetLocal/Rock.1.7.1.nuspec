        <releaseNotes>Rock McKinley 7.1

+ Added a delete confirmation when deleting members from the Leader Toolbox.
+ Added a new "Manage Members" security action to the group and grouptype models that can be used to grant users the ability to add, edit, and delete members in a group without having the ability to edit or delete the group.
+ Added a new Attribute type of Lava Field. This allows a Lava template to be added to entities that will render it's contents as the value. This will be helpful in creating more descriptive settings and configuration panels.
+ Added a new block setting that can be used to prevent entering a future date in the Group attendance detail block.
+ Added a new configuration option to the Attendance Analytics block to limit the available data views in the filter to specific category(s).
+ Added a new 'Label' field type. This makes it easier to add a label to a specific person and/or group that would always print when that person checks in, or when anyone checks into that group. This would be an advanced configuration done outside of normal check-in configuration block.
+ Added new blocks for viewing interaction data.
+ Fixed an exception that would occur in the statement generator if a pledge exists with a maximum end date value (12/31/9999).
+ Fixed an issue where the required field indicators were not showing on the New Family control.
+ Fixed an issue where Workflows would process the wrong User Entry Form if multiple forms existed in the same Activity or a single Activity was activated multiple times.
+ Fixed an issue with Check-in not displaying the correct message or the countdown timer whenever the kiosk was closed, but had an upcoming schedule for same day.
+ Fixed an issue with check-in when using the people/group/location auto check-in option that would allow people to check-in again to the same service even though option was selected to prevent this.
+ Fixed an issue with Font Awesome brand icons on the login block.
+ Fixed an issue with NMI transactions not saving the Name On Card value after processing a transaction.
+ Fixed an issue with not being able to select items when using an iOS device.
+ Fixed Attribute Editor to allow editing the default values of field types that have multiple entry fields (i.e. Group Role).
+ Fixed the EnumField and EnumsField attributes so that they support being used more than once on a block.
+ Fixed various field types so that an attribute value of these types can be reverted back to the default value.
+ Fixed workflow processing so that if a redirect action occurs with remaining workflow entry actions, the redirect still happens.
+ Updated communications to fix exception that would occur if certain communication fields (subject, from name, etc) were too long.
+ Updated the Attributes block to prevent  multiple global attributes being created with the same key.
+ Updated the Bootstrap Button to support a completed text and/or message that can be displayed for a set duration after the post back completes.
+ Updated the Bulk Update block to allow setting a new Communication Preference.
+ Updated the CodeEditor control so that it displays correctly, even if it is not initially set to be visible on a block.
+ Updated the Communication List block to use the communication name when subject is empty (i.e. for SMS communications).
+ Updated the Create Labels check-in action to look for labels configured on the person, group, and/or location objects in addition to just the group type object.
+ Updated the device search by hostname functionality in check-in to match against the IPAddress field.
+ Updated the editing of family attributes so that the updates get logged to history.
+ Updated the Group Member List block so that any group member note value will be displayed when hovering the mouse over the existing note icon. Also added an option to display the notes in a separate column instead of just showing an icon.
+ Updated the Merge Document process so that it will no longer delete word fields from the template when merging data.
+ Updated the metric detail block to show the Id of the metric to assist in Lava development using metrics.
+ Updated the 'Person Property Update' workflow action to support setting a person's communication preference value.
+ Updated the Schedule Detail block to support viewing and editing attributes associated with schedules.</releaseNotes>
