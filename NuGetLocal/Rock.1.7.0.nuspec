        <description>Rock McKinley 1.7.0 is a major update with several new features and improvements including a new communication wizard, support for BI Analytics, and many other awesome things!

&lt;div class='alert alert-warning margin-t-md'&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Heads Up!&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Important Technical Notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Page view and email activity data has been moved in Rock v7. While we make a huge effort to not break things during updates the transition of this data to new tables may break custom SQL or code that was querying this data from the PageView and/or CommunicationRecipientActivity tables. All of the data has been transitioned to their new home in the Interactions tables so you won't miss a thing. This should impact only a very small number of organizations who have written custom code or SQL against these few tables. Note that since there could be a large amount of data to convert from the old PageView and CommunicationRecipientActivity tables, a Rock Job called 'Move Data from PageViews and Communication Activity to the new Interaction Tables' will run at 4am after v7 is installed. This job could take an hour or so depending on how much data there is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The external giving blocks have a new 'Give as Business' option which defaults to 'on'. If you don't want your giving blocks to have the 'Give as Business' option, you'll have to change that manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a new 'Expiring Credit Card Notices' job which is enabled to run at 7:30 AM on the 1st of every month. It can be disabled manually if needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ZebraPhoto lava command was changed to use the R: (DRAM) location due to long term problems with repetitive writing to the E: (Flash) location.  Any labels using ZebraPhoto must also change their Recall Graphic (^XG) command to use the R: location too. &lt;a href='http://www.rockrms.com/lava/person#zebraphoto'&gt;http://www.rockrms.com/lava/person#zebraphoto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a new 'Database Maintenance' job that is enabled to run at 2:30 AM every day by default. If you SQL database already has a maintenance plan, update the 'Database Maintenance' job and/or your SQL Maintenance Plan to do what you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure to enable the Google Static Maps API in your Google API Manager dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A change was made in how group requirement notifications are sent out. Before it would send to all Roles marked 'IsLeader' of the group, with the ability to provide a list of Role Ids to exclude. This has been changed to use the 'Receive Requirements Notifications' property on the Role. If you have setup jobs to send group requirement emails you will want to ensure that you configure the roles you want to receive these emails to have the 'Receive Requirements Notifications' checked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staff and Staff-Like roles will be given Edit access to the following group types if those group types do not already have specific 'Edit' roles defined. This is so that staff can add new groups of those types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Serving Teams&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Small Group Section&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Small Group&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;General Group&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Organization Unit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ContentChannelView has been updated to not support legacy Lava syntax for accessing global attributes. To enable this, a new "Enable Legacy Global Attribute Lava" block setting needs to be set to true (which negatively affect performance of this block).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Group Attributes now enforce security. Edit each Group Type in General Settings &gt; Group Types, and make sure to set the security on each of the Group Attributes so they can be edited by the appropriate team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iScroll.js is now included in the RockLibs.js bundle. If you have a custom blocks (i.e. check-in) that is loading iScroll.js, this is no longer needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release fixes a bug where workflow activities marked as inactive were still being processed. If you have any activities where 'Is Active' is not checked they will no longer run even if you use the 'Activate Workflow Activity' action. This action activates an instance of an activity. The activity type however, must be active for this to occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description>
